# Pong Game
This repository contains the code files for a ping-pong Python app, which uses the turtle module to execute the functionality of the moving ball and the paddles, respectively.

For this app, the up and down arrow keys correspond to the right-most paddle while the w and s keys allow a user to move the left-most paddle up or down.
